What is Alexa?
Alexa is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based artificial inteligence (AI) voice service program.

What does it do? 
Alexa can play your favorite song or podcast, read the latest headlines, dim the lights in your living room, 
provide weather, order food and more.
Basically, Alexa wants to make your life easier and more fun by helping you voice control your world.

How does it work?
Alexa lives in the cloud, anywhere there's internet access and a device that can connect to Alexa.
Making Alexa part of your day is as simple as asking a question.
Say 'Alexa' before the question you want to ask and Alexa will respond.
It matches the words spoken to a database of information and returns the best match to the question/ command
